              “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and
              have
              heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it
              incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best ‐ and most grueling ‐ time
              of my
              life. Since completing the course. I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a
              VR

          “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
          professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
          did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
          project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
          could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
          experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
          100% recommend! ”
